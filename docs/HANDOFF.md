# Handoff

The single queue between story/design (Claude chat, Web-Mobile Game project) and build (Claude Code).
Both sides read this first and update it last. Keep it short: finished items move to Done with one line, then get deleted after a week.

## How it works

- **Chat** writes specs to `docs/story/<topic>.md` or `docs/design/<topic>.md`, then adds a line under Ready.
- **Claude Code** takes the top Ready item, moves it to In progress, builds it, runs the qa-runner agent, commits to `main`, and moves it to Done.
- Anything that needs Refindo's decision goes under Blocked, with the question.

Day-to-day guide: docs/PLAYBOOK.md. A nightly run (01:52 Jakarta) takes the top Ready item (text, UI, assets, tests only).

Designated build session (main code agent): https://claude.ai/code/session_01XC77HfFWyx7am3DE4jJY5f

Agents (in `.claude/agents/`): `script-integrator` (Haiku, story text), `qa-runner` (Haiku, tests and checks), `sim-specialist` (Opus, game rules and online). The main session runs on Sonnet.

## Ready

## In progress

## Blocked

- **Last open script mismatch** (proposed by story chat, waiting for Refindo). Level 1 tutorial step `martian` (tutorial_script.ts): "Martians chase you. Keep moving." → "Martians bite when they touch you. Keep your distance." Reason: sector 1 Gooplings wander; only sector 4 Martians hunt. All other old contradictions are fixed or no longer in the script.

## Done

- 2026-10-20: 7 script lines fixed to match the game (boss waves, Goopling, Sniffer x3, Freeze, Oxygen Vest, "break it"). 132 tests pass.
- 2026-10-20: story continuity A-D applied: cores taken by the creature, distress call revealed as a lure, Ducking is a wanted criminal hiding on Mars (the Division is gone from the script), level 10 voice "Not Martian. Not machine."
