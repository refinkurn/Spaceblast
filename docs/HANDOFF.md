# Handoff

The single queue between story/design (Claude chat, Web-Mobile Game project) and build (Claude Code).
Both sides read this first and update it last. Keep it short: finished items move to Done with one line, then get deleted after a week.

## How it works

- **Chat** writes specs to `docs/story/<topic>.md` or `docs/design/<topic>.md`, then adds a line under Ready.
- **Claude Code** takes the top Ready item, moves it to In progress, builds it, runs the qa-runner agent, commits to `main`, and moves it to Done.
- Anything that needs Refindo's decision goes under Blocked, with the question.

Day-to-day guide: docs/PLAYBOOK.md. Vision and milestones: docs/ROADMAP.md. Rule numbers: docs/GAME_RULES.md. Look and feel: docs/DESIGN.md (the Producer queues from it daily, 00:44 Jakarta). Phone checks waiting for Refindo: docs/PHONE_TEST.md. A nightly run (01:52 Jakarta) takes up to 4 Ready items from the top, one at a time (text, UI, input, assets, tests only).

Designated build session (main code agent): https://claude.ai/code/session_01XC77HfFWyx7am3DE4jJY5f

Agents (in `.claude/agents/`): `script-integrator` (Haiku, story text), `qa-runner` (Haiku, tests and checks), `sim-specialist` (Opus, game rules and online). The main session runs on Sonnet.

Hosting (details in ONLINE.md): game page on Vercel, https://spaceblast.vercel.app (every push builds it; `main` = live). Rooms + leaderboard on Cloudflare, https://spaceblast.refinkurn.workers.dev: Cloudflare Workers Builds deploys every push to `main` too, so a pushed server change goes live within minutes (and restarts any live match). Fly.io server code is in the repo but not deployed (not free).

## Ready

## In progress

- 2026-11-10, code session: M0 close-out and CrazyGames portal prep (plan agreed with Refindo). Producer: do not queue M0 or portal items; they are being built here.

## Blocked

- **Decide: Durable Object hibernation for idle lobbies** (assessed 2026-11-08, not built). Saves server time only while lobbies sit idle; rounds keep the clock anyway. Needs two deploys (a fixed-string ping the server can auto-answer, then the page switches to it), room state saved across eviction (seats, tokens, settings, version pin), a handler rewrite, and a new dev dependency (@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers) plus a manual check on Cloudflare. Risk: a lost seat/token after a wake-up blocks rejoin. Suggest: first check Durable Object duration in the Cloudflare dashboard; build only if idle lobbies cost real money.
- **Later (postponed by Refindo until the product is ready, no cost now): Capacitor app packaging** - landscape lock, native haptics (@capacitor/haptics: light impact on Charge / power-up, warning on damage). The web build already buzzes via navigator.vibrate on Android.

## Known issues

Open bugs and debts, newest first. The Producer turns these into Ready items when the milestone allows; fixed ones move to Done.


## Done

Older entries: docs/CHANGELOG.md.

- 2026-11-10: src/main.ts split from 720 to 333 lines, no behaviour change (session.ts, game_run.ts, battle_flow.ts, online_play.ts, event_handlers.ts, keyboard_flow.ts, screen_layout.ts, dev_hooks.ts in src/flow). New `npm run online-check` (two browsers, one room, one round). 515 tests, screenshots and the online check pass.

- 2026-11-10: launch prep (Refindo: "execute"). Portal build (`npm run build:portal`, docs/PORTAL.md: CrazyGames rules read from their docs); desktop players no longer see the touch stick and Charge button (they come back on a real touch); privacy page (public/privacy.html, linked from Credits); iPhone sound resumes on the next touch after an interruption; scripts `status`, `check`, `shots`, `live`; GitHub Actions: screenshot checks on every push and a live check after each deploy and daily; new `ui-builder` agent (Sonnet). Cloud environment "spaceblast" lets sessions reach the live game and the CrazyGames docs. Live check: both addresses run the same build.

- 2026-11-09: floating joystick rests in the middle of the left gutter when idle (was '50%' of the half-screen touch zone, i.e. over the arena's edge); clamped 4 px from the screen edge. Checked at 667/844/896 px wide. Phone checks for Ducking v0.3 and the balance passed (Refindo).

- 2026-11-08: online fixes (sim-specialist). Version check on join: the page sends its build (commit SHA) with ?v=; a room seats one version only; a mismatched page reloads once into the invite link, then shows "Everyone should reload". Host `start` ignored mid-round (a straggler that never reports the round over can hold the next round 10 s at most). A `profile` without a usable name keeps the seat's name. server/room.ts split into room.ts (288 lines), round_clock.ts, room_join.ts; build_version.ts derives the build. 512 tests pass. Every push now changes the version: a tab left open across any deploy reloads before it can join new rooms.
